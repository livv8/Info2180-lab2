		<h2> The Reality

			There are many days when a person may sit and think of how they may carry on their day but most time it might never end up the way they planned. 
		 Its just like the weather, we predict it but most times our predictions end up being wrong, and we still cant plan it.Nature has a way of being cruel but at the same time it can be the most wonderful thing to experience, for instance when you see on the news that an earthquake destroyed a whole country with thousands dead and you might comment with a sad heart "That is nature" but yet at the same time you look at the sunset and the different blends of color that are so beautiful that you have to ask " Is this the same ‘nature’ that shook that country to oblivion? " . Nature is defined as the phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations. And as such it is represented in various forms of life that we can see and experience daily or once in a life time, these are nature’s best features.

		<h3> The Weather by O.Hibbert September 30,2021</h3>
		<article> Clouds are formed when moist air rises upward. As the air rises, it becomes colder. Eventually the air can't hold all of the water vapor in it, and some of the water vapor condenses to form tiny water droplets. When moist air is cooled at the ground, fog is formed in the same way. Clouds form at a wide range of altitudes, from near the ground to very high in the atmosphere. The appearance of clouds varies a lot, depending on the motions of the air as the clouds are formed. Clouds have many effects on our climate besides simply hurling down hail and covering us in snow. For example, they serve as barriers for heat moving both in and out of the Earth's atmosphere. Researchers estimate that clouds' current net effect on our planet's atmosphere is to cool it slightly. Clouds generally affect the temperature in two ways. Low-level clouds reflect the greatest amount of heat, which is why we enjoy cooler temperatures during a cloudy day. Conversely, a cloudy night is warmer than a cloudless night because clouds also create a blanketing effect. Clouds partially absorb outgoing heat (such as the heat released in the evenings, as the ground cools) and reradiate a portion of that heat back towards the Earth's surface. High-level clouds typically absorb this outgoing heat.

There are different types of clouds such as, Stratus, Cumulus, Cirrus, Nimbus, these main types of clouds can be combined together thus obtaining more complex forms. After reading all this a deeper appreciation for clouds might be felt but who knows.



 Which type of weather do you like that includes clouds? Rainy? Snow?

Let me know.
